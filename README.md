After install globally, you can use it by simply doing `lexicon`
```bash

```
By using `lexicon` command you will be able to see some questions that will be asked to know your preference.

## This is how it will look like

```bash
 _                     _
 | |       ___  __  __ (_)   ___    ___    _ __
 | |      / _ \ \ \/ / | |  / __|  / _ \  | '_ \
 | |___  |  __/  >  <  | | | (__  | (_) | | | | |
 |_____|  \___| /_/\_\ |_|  \___|  \___/  |_| |_|

? What lanuage do you prefer? (Use arrow keys)
❯ java
  javascript
  python

```
By Choosing any language of your choice it will ask you the name of your file. 
if you choose `Javascript` it will look like something like this
```bash
? What lanuage do you prefer? javascript
? What's your file name?
```

After providing any name of your choice, it will generate the file into the `src` folder of root directory

Example filename `demoJsFileName`, it will generate a file inside `src/javascript/demoJsFileName.js` that will look like
```bash
'use strict';

function demoFunction() {
    return "Generated by @saptak/lexicon cli Template generator.";
}

function main() {
    let result = demoFunction();
    console.log(result);
}

main();
```
** Please Note that if you want any nested directory to be generated, you can do it easily by giving file name as
`exampleDir/exampleFilename`. 
It will generate the file of you choice inside `src/javascript/exampleDir/exampleFilename.js`

** For now only single command is supported.

** Command line arguments will be supported in future versions.
